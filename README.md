## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Logo File:** Make sure your logo is uploaded to exactly this path: `Arianna/Downloads/Tany Foods Logo.png`
- **Data Persistence:** Currently, all data (users, products, orders) is stored in **session state**. This means:
  - Data resets when the app restarts
  - For production, integrate a proper database (e.g., Firebase, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)

**Security:**
- Change admin credentials before going live  
- In production, implement proper password hashing  
- Use environment variables for sensitive data

**Mobile Optimization:** The app is designed to be mobile-responsive using Streamlit's layout features.
